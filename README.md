### ðŸ‘‹ Hiya welcome to my Github

I am Kami, a UK based junior software developer recently graduated from Software Engineering Bootcamp provided by Northcoders in Manchester. At the moment I am doing my best to sharpen my skills and apply my knowledge to reality by creating projects in various scale, exploring TypeScript, various frameworks as well as .NET(C#).

I am interested in creating applications which can help people life easier and any open source projects. I strongly believe the power of humanity comes from the collaboration.
